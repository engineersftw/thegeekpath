In every one of us there lies a seed of geekiness.

**Be curious.**  
Dip our toes into that little thing that catches our attention.  
Ask questions. Read widely.  
Seek unfamiliar experiences.  
Explore the jungles of information.  
Marvel at the vastness of what can be learnt.

**Be open-minded.**  
Make friends from all backgrounds. Be humble.  
Be receptive to all feedback.  
Connect ideas from vastly different domains.  
Experiment.

**Be supportive.**
Collaborate. Critique heartily. Be kind.  
Encourage newcomers.  
Share our crafts with the community.

**Be dedicated.**  
Compose music. Design electronics. Tinker with toys. Program software. Cook meals.  
Persevere through the long process.  
Mistakes are natural.  
It is in the doing that we vastly improve our craft.

**Be bold.**  
Have the courage to pursue our ambitions. Dig deeper with every discovery.  
Take every little step, every little detail, every little desire, every little discomfort, every little joy into the journey that makes us who we truly are.

**Be geeks.**
